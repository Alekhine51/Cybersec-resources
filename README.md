Hacking: The Art of Exploitation, 2nd Edition:

This is a great book. In this field, books become dated very quickly, but this book overcomes that barrier by focusing mostly on principles, instead of specific tools. You will learn the basics of C programming (a must for reverse engineers) and the techincal details of how to exploit vulnerabilities, plus a primer on cryptography.
